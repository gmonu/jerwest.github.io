List of Completed User Stories:
#6	As a user, when I scroll down, I want to see more relevant
	information

#7	As a user, when I look at and interact with the page, I expect 
	to have a pleasant UX experience, especially with the potential
	for information overload
	
#9	IF the user, HOVERS over some element(button, picture, logo etc)
	THEN button changes color/expands/ the pointer changes its look 
	to a finger instead of arrow etc other ideas

Project Write-Up:  A fitness tracker that allows users to enter data (weight, calories, activities, body type, etc.), to view, and to manipulate(edit or remove). They can view their progress and results through graphical (charts, tables, etc.) representation. Allows users to collaborate with coaches for optimal success and motivation for a nominal fee.
